It is is odd really, but there are times when one wakes up and he feels like he can do anything..
And then there are those other times where you feel like you can do fuck-all. Thankfully, today, even though I am feeling quite ill (yay for uni stress illnesses!), I feel as though I can be productive. Compared to the last week where I had very little motivation to do anything, this is a great achievement to say the least.

I can be quite strict with myself. I do tell myself off for having a bad day or week, but I don't do it out of self-harm. Well not anymore I don't think. I do it more out of providing impetus to get up off my bum and doing things again. I have for the past 5-7 years or so have had varying degrees of 'depression' and because of that it is truly difficult to do things sometimes. This is more difficult for me because people expect or at least to expect a lot from me. They saw that I could do things in a focused way, and be productive when they couldn't and they thought I could do anything. I still think this is possible for myself, but I do have a hurdle of my own emotions that I need to get over now. I like to think that I have sufficiently fell behind enough that people don't think too highly of me anymore and so I can continue my life the way that I want to.

I realize this isn't the best way to live one's life, and on reflection, isn't really something that I should consciously aim for. However, it has been what I have been doing subconsciously or not and it is reallllllyyyy something I should sort out. Well. For now at the moment, what I really need to do is focus on my uni work. Whether I like to or not, whether I would like to be a teacher, programmer, or real-estate developer in the future, it doesn't matter if I can't get past this hurdle of final year education.

So. That's what I am going to do today, and hopefully for the next 100ish days.

Get my shit done and live.
